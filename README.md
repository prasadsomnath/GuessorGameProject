# GuessorGameProject
The Guessor Game is a simple console-based number guessing game developed using Java. It demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as classes, objects, and encapsulation. The game is moderated by an Umpire class, which compares the guessed values and declares the result.
